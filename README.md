# Hack Stack Overflow Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Hack: a stack overflow error caused by excessive recursion. The `foo` function calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.  If a large number is passed as input, the recursion depth exceeds the limit, causing a stack overflow.  The solution demonstrates a more efficient iterative approach to factorial calculation.
